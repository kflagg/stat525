{\it A 20-year cohort study of British male physicians noted that the
proportion per year who died from lung cancer was 0.00140 for cigarette smokers
and 0.00010 for nonsmokers. The proportion who died from coronary heart disease
was 0.00669 for smokers and 0.00413 for nonsmokers.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item%a
{\it Describe the association of smoking with each of lung cancer and heart
disease, using the ER, NNH, RR, and OR. Interpret each of these.}

\textbf{Excess Risk:}
\begin{align*}
ER_\text{lung cancer}&=P(\text{lung cancer}|\text{smoker})
-P(\text{lung cancer}|\text{nonsmoker})\\
&=0.00140-0.00010\\
&=0.00130
\end{align*}
We expect the lung cancer mortality percentage to be 0.130\% higher among
smokers than nonsmokers assuming the populations are otherwise similar.
\begin{align*}
ER_\text{CHD}&=P(\text{CHD}|\text{smoker})-P(\text{CHD}|\text{nonsmoker})\\
&=0.00669-0.00413\\
&=0.00256
\end{align*}
We expect the coronary heart disease mortality percentage to be 0.256\% higher
among smokers than nonsmokers assuming the populations are otherwise similar.

\textbf{Number Needed to Harm:}

\begin{equation*}
NNH_\text{lung cancer}=\frac{1}{ER_\text{lung cancer}}
=\frac{1}{0.00130}=769.231
\end{equation*}
For every additional 769.231 smokers in the population, we expect one to die of
lung cancer.
\begin{equation*}
NNH_\text{CHD}=\frac{1}{ER_\text{CHD}}=\frac{1}{0.00256}=390.625
\end{equation*}
For every additional 390.625 smokers in the population, we expect one to die of
coronary heart disease.

\textbf{Relative Risk:}
\begin{align*}
RR_\text{lung cancer}&=\frac{P(\text{lung cancer}|\text{smoker})}
{P(\text{lung cancer}|\text{nonsmoker})}\\
&=\frac{0.00140}{0.00010}\\
&=14.0
\end{align*}
The risk of death from lung cancer for smokers is 14 times as high as the risk
of death from lung cancer for nonsmokers.
\begin{align*}
RR_\text{CHD}&=\frac{P(\text{CHD}|\text{smoker})}
{P(\text{CHD}|\text{nonsmoker})}\\
&=\frac{0.00669}{0.00413}\\
&=1.620
\end{align*}
The risk of death from coronary heart disease for smokers is 1.62 times as high
as the risk of death from coronary heart disease for nonsmokers.

\textbf{Odds ratio:}
\begin{align*}
OR_\text{lung cancer}&=\frac{P(\text{lung cancer}|\text{smoker})/
P(\text{no lung cancer}|\text{smoker})}{P(\text{lung cancer}|\text{nonsmoker})/
P(\text{no lung cancer}|\text{nonsmoker})}\\
&=\frac{0.00140/(1-0.00140)}{0.00010/(1-0.00010)}\\
&=14.02
\end{align*}
The odds of dying from lung cancer for smokers are 14.02 times as high as the
odds of dying from lung cancer for nonsmokers.
\begin{align*}
OR_\text{CHD}&=\frac{P(\text{CHD}|\text{smoker})/
P(\text{no CHD}|\text{smoker})}{P(\text{CHD}|\text{nonsmoker})/
P(\text{no CHD}|\text{nonsmoker})}\\
&=\frac{0.00669/(1-0.00669)}{0.00413/(1-0.00413)}\\
&=1.624
\end{align*}
The odds of dying from coronary heart disease for smokers are 1.624 times as
high as the odds of dying from coronary heart disease for nonsmokers.

\item%b
{\it Which response (lung cancer or coronary heart disease deaths) is more
strongly related to cigarette smoking in terms of the reduction in number of
deaths that would occur with elimination of cigarettes? Explain. (Do not try to
get AR for this one. Just answer it using the information in (a).)}

Cigarette smoking is more strongly related to CHD than to lung cancer because
CHD has a larger excess risk. For every 10,000 people who give up smoking, we
expect 25.6 fewer CHD mortalities, but only 13.0 fewer lung cancer mortalities.

\item%c
{\it Why are RR and OR so close to one another in both responses?}

RR and OR are similar because lung cancer and CHD are very rare in both
populations.

{\it Problem 4.5 on page 42.}

Incidence is computed by counting only those individuals who were diagnosed
with high blood pressure during the follow-up period or who were never
diagnosed with high blood pressure, ignoring those who were diagnosed
with high blood pressure before the follow-up period began. Prevalence is
computed using the entire population, including those who had high blood
pressure at the start of the follow-up period. If those with high stress really
do have a larger risk of high blood pressure, then it is possible that a large
portion of the high stress group already had high blood pressure at the
beginning of the study and were counted in the prevalence calculation but not
in the incidence calculation.

\item%3
{\it A study looked at the relationship between the presence of squamous cell
carcinoma (yes, no) and smoking behavior. There were 3 categories of smoking
behavior: nonsmoker, light smoker (\(\leq\) 20 cigarettes per day) and heavy
smoker (\(>\) 20 cigarettes per day). The estimated OR for females between the
presence of carcinoma and smoking behavior (nonsmoker, light smoker) was 11.7.
The corresponding OR for females between the presence of carcinoma and smoking
behavior (nonsmoker, heavy smoker) was 26.1. Find the estimated OR between
carcinoma and smoking behavior (light smoker, heavy smoker). You must justify
any calculations.}

First, let's define notation for the exposure events: let \(N\) denote a
nonsmoker, \(L\) denote a light smoker, and \(H\) denote a heavy smoker.
\(C\) denotes carcinoma. Then the OR for carcinoma between light smokers and
heavy smokers is
\begin{align*}
OR_{LH}&=\frac{P\left(C|H\right)/P\left(\overline{C}|H\right)}{P\left(C|L\right)/P\left(\overline{C}|L\right)}\\
&=\frac{\left(\frac{P\left(C|H\right)/P\left(\overline{C}|H\right)}{P\left(C|N\right)/P\left(\overline{C}|N\right)}\right)}
{\left(\frac{P\left(C|L\right)/P\left(\overline{C}|L\right)}{P\left(C|N\right)/P\left(\overline{C}|N\right)}\right)}\\
&=\frac{OR_{NH}}{OR_{NL}}\\
&=\frac{26.1}{11.7}\\
&=2.23
\end{align*}

{\it A study exploring the relationship between exposure to a risk factor and a
disease used a simple random sample of 100,000 exposed individuals and a simple
random sample of 200,000 unexposed individuals. Disease status was subsequently
determined for the individuals in the samples. The results are shown below.}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|cc|c}
& \(D\) & \(\overline{D}\) & \\
\hline
\(E\) & 250 & 99,750 & 100,000 \\
\(\overline{E}\) & 125 & 199,875 & 200,000 \\
\hline
& 375 & 299,625 & 300,000
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
{\it They estimate \(P(D)\) = 375/300,000 = 0.00125 and
\(P\left(D|\overline{E}\right)\) = 125/200,000 and then estimate attributable
risk as}
\begin{equation}
AR=\frac{0.00125-0.000625}{0.00125}=0.5
\end{equation}
{\it which they interpret by writing ``The disease could be reduced by 50\% if
we could eliminate the risk factor.''}

{\it Give two major flaws with this interpretation for this particular problem.
There is one you MUST give to get credit.}

First, they used a cohort design (sampling conditional on exposure), so the
distribution of exposure status in their sample is not representative of the
population, and therefore it is not appropriate to use the marginal proportion
to estimate \(P(D)\) and compute the AR.

Second, their interpretation assumes that there are no differences between the
exposed and unexposed populations except for exposure status for this one risk
factor. This risk factor \(E\) could be associated with another factor \(F\)
not considered in this study. If there is an association between \(D\) and
\(F\), eliminating \(E\) would not have the result the authors expect.

{\it Carry out a test of independence. Show the tables of expected counts and
the standardized Pearson residuals. What do the results indicate about the
association between heart disease and hair loss? Donâ€™t just say there is a lack
of independence -- I want some idea of where the independence is breaking
down.}

The continuity-corrected Pearson test indicates very strong evidence of an

Examining the standardized residuals, we see a very large residual of
<<sixa5, results = 'asis'>>=
cat(sprintf('%.2f', test$residuals['Balding', 'Heart Disease']))
@
for the subjects with hair loss and heart disease. This means that male
physicians with hair loss are more likely to get CHD than are male physicians
without hair loss.

\textbf{Excess Risk:}

We are 95\% confident that the probability of heart disease is between 0.0113
